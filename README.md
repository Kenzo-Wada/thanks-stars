# üåü Thanks Stars

Thanks Stars is a command-line companion that stars the GitHub repositories powering your project so you can show appreciation to the maintainers of your dependencies. It draws inspiration from [teppeis/thank-you-stars](https://github.com/teppeis/thank-you-stars), but reimagines the experience in Rust with first-class support for multiple ecosystems.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- Detects dependencies across popular package managers and build tools.
- Uses your GitHub personal access token to star repositories on your behalf.
- Provides friendly progress output and summarizes what happened at the end of a run.

## üß≠ Supported Ecosystems

The following ecosystems are currently detected when you run the tool:

| Ecosystem       | Detection Source                                                               | Implementation                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cargo (Rust)    | `Cargo.toml`                                                                   | [`src/ecosystems/cargo.rs`](src/ecosystems/cargo.rs)       |
| Node.js         | `package.json`                                                                 | [`src/ecosystems/node.rs`](src/ecosystems/node.rs)         |
| Go (Go Modules) | `go.mod`                                                                       | [`src/ecosystems/go.rs`](src/ecosystems/go.rs)             |
| Composer (PHP)  | `composer.lock` / `composer.json`                                              | [`src/ecosystems/composer.rs`](src/ecosystems/composer.rs) |
| Ruby (Bundler)  | `Gemfile` / `Gemfile.lock`                                                     | [`src/ecosystems/ruby.rs`](src/ecosystems/ruby.rs)         |
| Python          | `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` / `Pipfile` / `Pipfile.lock` / `uv.lock` | [`src/ecosystems/python.rs`](src/ecosystems/python.rs)     |

Looking for support for a different ecosystem? [Open an ecosystem support request](https://github.com/Kenzo-Wada/thanks-stars/issues/new?template=ecosystem_support_request.md) and tell us about the manifest and lockfiles we should detect.

## üöÄ Installation

Choose the installation method that best fits your environment:

### üç∫ Homebrew

```bash
$ brew tap Kenzo-Wada/thanks-stars
$ brew install thanks-stars
```

### ü¶Ä Cargo

```bash
$ cargo install thanks-stars
```

### üíª Shell installer (macOS/Linux)

```bash
$ curl -LSfs https://github.com/Kenzo-Wada/thanks-stars/releases/latest/download/thanks-stars-installer.sh | sh
```

### ü™ü PowerShell installer (Windows)

```powershell
$ iwr https://github.com/Kenzo-Wada/thanks-stars/releases/latest/download/thanks-stars-installer.ps1 -useb | iex
```

### üêß Linux package managers

Native packages like `apt`/`apt-get`, `pacman`, `nix`, etc... are not published yet. Until a maintainer volunteers to host those repositories, please use one of the installers above or the manual download method. Contributions toward official Linux packages are very welcome‚Äîsee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for coordination details.

### üì¶ Manual download

Grab the archive for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kenzo-Wada/thanks-stars/releases) page and place the `thanks-stars` binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

## üõ† Usage

Authenticate once with a GitHub personal access token, then run the tool in the root of your project.

### Authenticate with GitHub

```bash
$ thanks-stars auth --token ghp_your_token_here
```

If you omit `--token`, the command will prompt you to paste it securely. By default the configuration is stored in a user-specific `config.toml`; you can override the storage location with the `THANKS_STARS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

### Run inside your project

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
$ thanks-stars
```

Example output:

```
$ thanks-stars
‚≠ê Starred https://github.com/xxx/xxx via Cargo.toml
‚≠ê Starred https://github.com/xxx/xxx via package.json
...
‚ú® Completed! Starred 10 repositories.
```

Run `thanks-stars --help` to explore all available options.

#### Preview your run with `--dry-run`

If you want to see which repositories would be starred without making any
changes to your GitHub account, pass the `--dry-run` flag:

```
$ thanks-stars --dry-run
‚≠ê Would star https://github.com/xxx/xxx via Cargo.toml
‚≠ê Already starred https://github.com/xxx/yyy via package.json
‚ú® Dry run complete! 1 repository would be starred, 1 already starred.
```

The command still inspects your dependencies so it can report which ones are
already starred, but it avoids sending any API requests that would change your
starred repositories.

Thanks Stars helps you recognize the maintainers who keep your stack running‚Äîso while you're at it, don't forget to ‚≠ê this project too!
